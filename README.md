2. Restart the command prompt
3. Download the [source code](https://github.com/SnaveSutit/datapack-warp-stones/archive/main.zip) and unzip it
4. Rename the file from `main` to `Warp Stones`
5. Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder you just unzipped and renamed
6. Run `mcb -build` in the command prompt. It will perform a single build, and then exit
